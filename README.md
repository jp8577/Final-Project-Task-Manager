## Project Description
* Why is it important or interesting to you?
  Time management is a common issue for college students so it is important to have an organized timeline when dealing with school, work, and other life events.

* What languages/tools/technologies do you plan to use? (This list may change over the course of the project)
  We plan to do this project in C++ using github to coordinate and use .txt files to save and import dates and events.

* What will be the input/output of your project?
  The output of the project will be in a chalendar format in the terminal. There will be menu options and the user will be able to select an option where they can input different tasks.

* What are the features that the project provides?
  Task categories such as school, chores, fun, family, etc. The ability to see the whole month, how many days have tasks, and how busy the days will be. Tasks will have specific times and dates associated with   
  them to aid in organization.

## Phase II
In addition to completing the "User Interface Specification" and "Class Diagram" sections below, you will need to:
* Create an "Epic" (note) for each feature. Place these epics in the `Product Backlog` column
* Complete your first *sprint planning* meeting to plan out the next 7 days of work.
* Break down the "Epics" into smaller actionable user stories (i.e. smaller development tasks). Convert them into issues and assign them to team members. Place these in the `TODO` (aka Sprint Backlog) column.
* These cards should represent roughly 7 days worth of development time for your team. Then, once the sprint is over you should be repeating these steps to plan a new sprint, taking you until your second scrum meeting with the reader in phase III.
* Schedule two check-ins using Calendly. You need to pick both time slots on Tuesday of week 6. The check-ins will occur on Zoom. Your entire team must be present for both check-ins.
* The first check-in needs to be scheduled with your lab TA. During that meeting, you will discuss your project design/class diagram from phase II.
* The second check-in should be scheduled with a reader. During that meeting you will discuss:
* The tasks you are planning for the first sprint
* How work will be divided between the team members
## User Interface Specification
Include a navigation diagram for your screens and the layout of each of those screens as desribed below. For all the layouts/diagrams, you can use any tool such as PowerPoint or a drawing program. (Specification requirement is adapted from [this template](https://redirect.cs.umbc.edu/~mgrass2/cmsc345/Template_UI.doc))

### Navigation Diagram
Draw a diagram illustrating how the user can navigate from one screen to another. Here is an [example](https://creately.com/diagram/example/ikfqudv82/user-navigation-diagram-classic?r=v). It can be useful to label each symbol that represents a screen so that you can reference the screens in the next section or the rest of the document if necessary. Give a brief description of what the diagram represents.

The Navigation diagram first portrays a calendar of a specific date provided. Then it is placed in a view screen where the calendar month is shown as well as the tasks on a certain day. From the view screen, the user is allowed to go into an edit screen where they are then given an option to either add a task to the date, delete a task, or edit the task that it currently is on. The diagram represents that you are able to travel backward from each screen depending on what the user wants to do.


### Screen Layouts
Include the layout of each of your screens. The layout should describe the screen’s major components such as menus and prompts for user inputs, expected output, and buttons (if applicable). Explain what is on the layout, and the purpose of each menu item, button, etc. If many screens share the same layout, start by describing the general layout and then list the screens that will be using that layout and the differences between each of them.

## Class Diagram
Include a **class diagram(s)** for your project and a **description** of the diagram(s). Your class diagram(s) should include all the main classes you plan for the project. This should be in sufficient detail so that another group could pick up the project this point and successfully complete it. Use proper UML notation (as discussed in the course slides).

 
## Phase III
You will need to schedule a check-in for the second scrum meeting with the same reader you had your first scrum meeting with (using Calendly). Your entire team must be present. This meeting will occur on Zoom and should be conducted by Wednesday of week 8.
 
BEFORE the meeting you should do the following:
* Update your class diagram from Phase II to include any feedback you received from your TA/grader.
* Considering the SOLID design principles, reflect back on your class diagram and think about how you can use the SOLID principles to improve your design. You should then update the README.md file by adding the following:
* A new class diagram incorporating your changes after considering the SOLID principles.
* For each update in your class diagram, you must explain in 3-4 sentences:
* What SOLID principle(s) did you apply?
* How did you apply it? i.e. describe the change.
* How did this change help you write better code?
* Perform a new sprint plan like you did in Phase II.
* You should also make sure that your README file (and Project board) are up-to-date reflecting the current status of your project and the most recent class diagram. Previous versions of the README file should still be visible through your commit history.
 
During the meeting with your reader you will discuss: 
* How effective your last sprint was (each member should talk about what they did)
* Any tasks that did not get completed last sprint, and how you took them into consideration for this sprint
* Any bugs you've identified and created issues for during the sprint. Do you plan on fixing them in the next sprint or are they lower priority?
* What tasks you are planning for this next sprint.

 
## Final deliverable
All group members will give a demo to the reader during lab time. ou should schedule your demo on Calendly with the same reader who took your second scrum meeting. The reader will check the demo and the project GitHub repository and ask a few questions to all the team members. 
Before the demo, you should do the following:
* Complete the sections below (i.e. Screenshots, Installation/Usage, Testing)
* Plan one more sprint (that you will not necessarily complete before the end of the quarter). Your In-progress and In-testing columns should be empty (you are not doing more work currently) but your TODO column should have a full sprint plan in it as you have done before. This should include any known bugs (there should be some) or new features you would like to add. These should appear as issues/cards on your Project board.
* Make sure your README file and Project board are up-to-date reflecting the current status of your project (e.g. any changes that you have made during the project such as changes to your class diagram). Previous versions should still be visible through your commit history. 
 
 ## Screenshots
Screenshots of the input/output after running your application
 ## Installation/Usage
Instructions on installing and running your application
 ## Testing
How was your project tested/validated? If you used CI, you should have a "build passing" badge in this README.
